# Principal_Components_Analysis-Clustering

- fitting a random forest classifier using the 784 explanatory variables and the model training set.

- Execute principal components analysis on the combine training and test set data together, generating principal    components that represent 95 percent of the variability in the explanatory variables.

- Using the identified principal components previous step, use the train.csv to build another random forest classifier.

- Use k-eans clustering to group MNIST observations into 1 of 10 categories and assign lables.
